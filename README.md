# SC-Haptics

A fork/rewrite of [SeekNDs Realism Enhancement Project](https://github.com/SeekND/Realism-enhancement) focusing on the [bHaptics Tactsuit x40](https://www.bhaptics.com/tactsuit/tactsuit-x40/.)

The joystick controls are mapped to the [Thrustmaster T.16000M FCS Duo](https://shop.thrustmaster.com/en_eu/t-16000m-fcs-space-sim-duo.html) flightsticks. 
(Using [BuzzKiller's](https://www.reddit.com/user/BuzZz_Killer/submitted/) bindings as a reference.)
